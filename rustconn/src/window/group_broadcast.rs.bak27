//! Cross-tab keystroke broadcast (issue #329).
//!
//! Split-view broadcast (see [`crate::window::navigation_actions`]) mirrors
//! keystrokes across the panes of one tab, whose state lives on a per-tab
//! [`crate::split_view::SplitViewBridge`]. A *group* broadcast spans sessions
//! that each live on their own tab, so its state cannot live on any one bridge —
//! it lives on [`GroupBroadcast`], owned by the window.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! Membership is an **explicit per-session opt-in**, not derived from an
//! existing tab-group label. The user adds a tab to the broadcast set from the
//! tab context menu; the set is a plain `HashSet<Uuid>` of session ids. This is
//! the iTerm2 model, and it avoids the trap iTerm2 itself hit once
//! (<https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/issues/3671>) where a broadcast whose
//! target set was *inferred* rather than explicit silently reached sessions the
//! user did not intend.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! A group broadcast is inherently more dangerous than the split one: the target
//! tabs are not all visible at once, so a `rm -rf` typed once lands on hosts the
//! user cannot see. Three guards, all owned here or by the window that drives
//! this type:
//!
//! - typing only mirrors while [`GroupBroadcast::is_active`] — an explicit,
//!   persistently-bannered mode, never on by accident;
//! - every commit re-checks live membership, because the VTE `commit` handler is
//!   wired once and never removed (a tab dropped from the set keeps its handler);
//! - only terminal-backed sessions participate — an embedded RDP/VNC/SPICE
//!   viewer has no PTY to feed and is skipped by the caller.
//!
//! The persistent banner and the large-group confirmation live in the window
//! layer, not here, but they exist because of this type.
